# Migrating SQL databases to Azure before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements

- Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.
  - Trial subscriptions will _not_ work.

> **Important**: You must have sufficient rights within your Azure AD tenant to create an Azure Active Directory application and service principal and assign roles on your subscription to complete this hands-on lab.

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 15 minutes

In this exercise, you set up your environment for use in the rest of the hands-on lab. You should follow all steps provided _before_ attending the Hands-on lab.

> **Important**: Many Azure resources require globally unique names. Throughout these steps, the word "SUFFIX" appears as part of resource names. You should replace this with your Microsoft alias, initials, or other value to ensure uniquely named resources.

### Task 1: Create a resource group

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups** from the Azure services list.

   ![Resource groups is highlighted in the Azure services list.](media/azure-services-resource-groups.png "Navigate to resource group")

2. On the Resource groups blade, select **+ Create**.

   ![Create is highlighted in the toolbar on Resource groups blade.](media/resource-groups-add.png "Create resource group")

3. On the Create a resource group **Basics** tab, enter the following:

   - **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.
   - **Resource group**: Enter `hands-on-lab-SUFFIX` as the name of the new resource group.
   - **Region**: Select the region you are using for this hands-on lab.

   ![The values specified above are entered into the Create a resource group Basics tab.](media/create-resource-group.png "Create resource group")

4. Select **Review + Create**.

5. On the **Review + create** tab, ensure the Validation passed message is displayed and then select **Create**.

### Task 2: Register the Microsoft DataMigration resource provider

In this task, you register the `Microsoft.DataMigration` resource provider with your Azure subscription. Registration of this resource provider is necessary to create an Azure Database Migration Service within your subscription.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), from the **home page**, select **Subscriptions** from the Azure services list.

   ![Subscriptions is highlighted in the Azure services list.](media/azure-services-subscriptions.png "Azure services")

2. Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab from the list.

   ![The target subscription is highlighted in the subscriptions list.](media/azure-subscriptions.png "Subscriptions list")

3. On the Subscription blade, select **Resource providers** from the left-hand menu and then enter "migration" into the filter box.

   ![Resource providers is highlighted in the left-hand menu of the Subscription blade. On the Resource providers blade, migration is entered into the filter box.](media/azure-portal-subscriptions-resource-providers-register-microsoft-datamigration.png "Resource provider registration")

4. If the `Microsoft.DataMigration` provider's status is `NotRegistered`, select **Register** in the toolbar.

   ![The Register button is highlighted in the Resource Providers toolbar.](media/azure-subscriptions-resource-providers-toolbar.png "Resource providers toolbar")

5. It can take a couple of minutes for the registration to complete. Make sure you see the status set to **Registered** before moving on. You may need to select **Refresh** on the toolbar to see the updated status.

   ![Registered is highlighted next to the Microsoft.DataMigration resource provider.](media/resource-providers-datamigration-registered.png "Microsoft DataMigration Resource Provider")

### Task 3: Validate subscription compatibility with SQL MI

Before running the ARM template, it is beneficial to quickly verify that you can provision SQL Managed Instance in your subscription.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **+Create a resource**.

   ![Create a resource from Azure Portal home page.](media/create-a-resource.png "Create a resource")

2. Enter **sql managed instance** into the Search the Marketplace box.
3. Then select **Azure SQL Managed Instance** from the results.

   ![+Create a resource is selected in the Azure navigation pane, and "sql managed instance" is entered into the Search the Marketplace box. Azure SQL Managed Instance is selected in the results.](media/create-resource-sql-mi.png "Create SQL Managed Instance")

4. Select **Create** on the Azure SQL Managed Instance blade.

   ![The Create button is highlighted on the Azure SQL Managed Instance blade.](media/sql-mi-create.png "Create Azure SQL Managed Instance")

5. On the SQL managed instance blade, look for a message stating that "Managed instance creation is not available for the chosen subscription type...", which will be displayed near the bottom of the SQL managed instance blade.

   ![A message is displayed stating that SQL MI creation not available in the selected subscription.](media/sql-mi-creation-not-available.png "SQL MI creation not available")

   > **Note**: If you see the message stating that Managed Instance creation is not available for the chosen subscription type, follow the instructions for [obtaining a larger quota for SQL Managed Instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-resource-limits#obtaining-a-larger-quota-for-sql-managed-instance) before proceeding with the following steps.

6. Be happy if you don't have any warnings! Just **cancel** the current operation by closing the blade.

   ![The closing button is located on top left below user name.](media/cancel-resource-sql-mi.png "Cancel SQL MI resource creation")

### Task 4: Run ARM template to provision lab resources

In this task, you run an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template to create the resources required for this hands-on lab. The components are deployed inside a new virtual network (VNet) to facilitate communication between the VMs and SQL MI. The ARM template also adds inbound and outbound security rules to the network security groups associated with SQL MI and the VMs, including opening port 3389 to allow RDP connections to the JumpBox. The resources created by the ARM template include:

- A virtual network with three subnets, ManagedInstance, Management, and a Gateway subnet.
- A virtual network gateway associated with the Gateway subnet.
- A route table.
- Azure SQL Managed Instance (SQL MI), added to the ManagedInstance subnet.
- A JumpBox with Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition
- A SQL Server 2008 R2 VM added to the Management subnet.
- Azure Database Migration Service (DMS).
- Azure App Service Plan and App Service (Web App).
- Azure Blob Storage account.

> **Note**: You can review the steps to manually provision and configure the lab resources in the [Manual resource setup guide](./Manual-resource-setup.md).

You are now ready to begin the ARM template deployment.

1. To open a custom deployment screen in the Azure portal, use Azure search bar and type **deploy**:
2. Select the **Deploy a custom template** service in search results.

   ![Deploy a custom template by using search bar.](media/deploy-custom-template.png "Deploy custom template")

   > **Note**: Running the ARM template occasionally results in a `ResourceDeploymentFailure` error, with a code of `VnetSubnetConflictedWithIntendedPolicy`. This error is not caused by an issue with the ARM template and appears to be the result of backend resource deployment issues in Azure. At this time, the workaround is first to try the deployment in a different region. If that does not work, try going through the [Manual resource setup guide](./Manual-resource-setup.md) to create the SQL MI database.

3. On the custom deployment screen, select the **Build your own template in the editor** button.

   ![Locate and select the Build your own template in the editor button.](media/build-template-button.png "Build template button")

4. Use the **Load file** button or paste the contents of the file **Hands-on lab/lab-files/ARM-template/azure-deploy.json** from the repository.

5. Select the **Save** button to validate the template.

   ![Load file or paste content from lab file azure-deploy.json from ARM-template folder .](media/load-template-file.png "Load template file")

6. On the next custom deployment, check that **19 resources** are about to be created.

7. Only fill **two settings** into the deployment form, and **leave others as default**:

   - **Resource group**: Select the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group from the dropdown list.
   - **Managed Instance Name**: Provide a globally unique value, such as **sqlmi-SUFFIX**.

8. Then select **Review + create** to review the custom deployment.

   ![The Custom deployment blade is displayed, and the information above is entered on the Custom deployment blade.](media/azure-custom-deployment.png "Custom deployment blade")

9. Wait for the **Review + create** blade to refresh, and ensure the _Validation passed_ message is displayed. Finally, select **Create** to begin the custom deployment.

   ![On the Review + create blade for the custom deployment, the Validation passed message is highlighted, and the Create button is highlighted.](media/azure-custom-deployment-review-create.png "Review + create custom deployment")

   > **Note**: The deployment of the custom ARM template can take over 4 hours due to the inclusion of SQL MI. However, the deployment of most of the resources completes within a few minutes. The JumpBox and SQL Server 2008 R2 VMs should finish in about 15 minutes.

10. You can monitor the deployment's progress any time by navigating to the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group in the Azure portal and then selecting **Deployments** from the left-hand menu. The deployment is named **Microsoft.Template-xxxxxxx**. Select that to view the progress of each item in the template.

![The Deployments menu item is selected in the left-hand menu of the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group and the Microsoft.Template deployment is highlighted.](media/resource-group-deployments.png "Resource group deployments")

> Check back in a few hours to monitor the progress of your SQL MI provisioning. If the provisioning goes on for longer than 7 hours, you may need to issue a support ticket in the Azure portal to request the provisioning process be unblocked by Microsoft support.

### Task 5: Prepare the Jump Box

In this Task, you will install SQL Server Management Studio on the JumpBox. You will utilize this tool to manage the SQL Server 2008 R2 instance and eventually the SQL MI instance. You will also obtain a copy of the lab repository.

1. On your JumpBox VM blade, select **Connect** and **RDP** from the top menu.

   ![The JumpBox VM blade is displayed, with the Connect and RDP button highlighted in the top menu.](./media/connect-vm-rdp.png "Connect to JumpBox VM")

18. When prompted, choose to save the file and then select Open folder.

    ![The download bar is displayed in Internet Explorer, and Open folder is highlighted.](media/ie-download-open-folder.png "Internet Explorer")

19. Once it is downloaded, extract the ZIP file to `C:\hands-on-lab`.

    ![In the Extract Compressed Zip File dialog, C:\hands-on-lab is entered into the destination field.](media/extract-compressed-zip.png "Extract Compressed Zip")

    > **Important**: Ensure you use the path above, or something similarly short. Failure to do so could result in errors opening some of the files due to a long file path.

### Task 6: Install DMA on the SQL Server 2008 VM

In this Task, you will install the Data Migration Assistant and .NET Framework 4.8, a dependency.

1. As you did for the JumpBox, navigate to the SqlServer2008 VM blade in the Azure portal, select **Overview** from the left-hand menu, and then select **Connect** and **RDP** on the top menu.

    ![Proceed with complete installation when prompted.](media/proceed-complete-installation.png "Proceed complete installation")

17. As with the previous installation, start by selecting **Next**. Scroll down the license terms, **Accept** them, and select the **Install** button.

### Task 7: Configure the WideWorldImporters database on the SqlServer2008 VM

In this task, you restore and configure the `WideWorldImporters` database on the SQL Server 2008 R2 instance.

#### Restore database

1. On the SqlServer2008 VM, download a [backup of the WideWorldImporters database](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/Migrating-SQL-databases-to-Azure/master/Hands-on%20lab/lab-files/Database/WideWorldImporters.bak) (<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/Migrating-SQL-databases-to-Azure/master/Hands-on%20lab/lab-files/Database/WideWorldImporters.bak>). Then save it to your `C:\Users\sqlmiuser\Downloads` of the VM, and copy the file to the `D:\`.

   > **Note**: Accessing **Download** folder is not authorized from SQL Server Management Studio, while `D:\` is.
   > **Hint**: Copy file URL to VM using Internet Explorer: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/Migrating-SQL-databases-to-Azure/master/Hands-on%20lab/lab-files/Database/WideWorldImporters.bak`

2. Next, open **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17** (SSMS) by entering **sql server** into the search bar in the Windows Start menu and selecting **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio** from the search results.

   ![SQL Server is entered into the Windows Start menu search box, and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17 is highlighted in the search results.](media/start-menu-ssms-17.png "Windows start menu search")

3. In the SSMS **Connect to Server** dialog, enter **SQLSERVER2008** into the Server name box, ensure **Windows Authentication** is selected, and then select **Connect**.

   ![The SQL Server Connect to Search dialog is displayed, with SQLSERVER2008 entered into the Server name and Windows Authentication selected.](media/sql-server-connect-to-server.png "Connect to Server")

4. Once connected, right-click **Databases** under **SQLSERVER2008** in the Object Explorer, and then select **Restore Database** from the context menu.

   ![In the SSMS Object Explorer, the context menu for Databases is displayed and Restore Database is highlighted.](media/ssms-databases-restore.png "SSMS Object Explorer")

5. You will now restore the `WideWorldImporters` database using the downloaded `WideWorldImporters.bak` file. On the **General** page of the Restore Database dialog, select **Device** under Source, and then select the Browse (`...`) button to the right of the Device box.

   ![Under Source in the Restore Database dialog, Device is selected and highlighted, and the Browse button is highlighted.](media/ssms-restore-database-source.png "Restore Database source")

6. In the **Select backup devices** dialog that appears, select **Add**.

   ![In the Select backup devices dialog, the Add button is highlighted.](media/ssms-restore-database-select-devices.png "Select backup devices")

7. In the **Locate Backup File** dialog, browse to the location you saved the downloaded `WideWorldImporters.bak` file, select that file, and then select **OK**.

   ![In the Location Backup File dialog, the WideWorldImporters.bak file is selected and highlighted.](media/ssms-restore-database-locate-backup-file.png "Locate Backup File")

8. Select **OK** on the **Select backup devices** dialog. This returns you to the Restore Database dialog. The dialog now contains the information required to restore the `WideWorldImporters` database.

9. Select the restore checkmark. Select **WideWorldImporters** from the **Database** menu. Then, select **OK** to start to restore.

   ![The completed Restore Database dialog is displayed, with the WideWorldImporters database specified as the target.](media/ssms-restore-database.png "Restore Database")

10. Select **OK** in the dialog when the database restore is complete.

    ![A dialog is displayed with a message the database WideWorldImporters was restored successfully.](media/ssms-restore-database-success.png "Restored successfully")

#### Configure database user and service

1. Next, you execute a script in SSMS to create the `WorkshopUser` account. To create the script, open a new query window in SSMS by selecting **New Query** in the SSMS toolbar.

   ![The New Query button is highlighted in the SSMS toolbar.](media/ssms-new-query.png "SSMS Toolbar")

2. Copy and paste the SQL script below into the new query window:

   ```sql
   USE master;
   GO

   CREATE LOGIN WorkshopUser WITH PASSWORD = N'Password.1234567890';

   EXEC sp_addsrvrolemember
      @loginame = N'WorkshopUser',
      @rolename = N'sysadmin';
   GO

   -- Assign the user to the WideWorldImporters database
   USE WideWorldImporters;
   GO

   IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.database_principals WHERE name = N'WorkshopUser')
   BEGIN
      CREATE USER [WorkshopUser] FOR LOGIN [WorkshopUser]
      EXEC sp_addrolemember N'db_datareader', N'WorkshopUser'
   END;
   GO
   ```

3. To run the script, select **Execute** from the SSMS toolbar.

   ![The Execute button is highlighted in the SSMS toolbar.](media/ssms-execute.png "SSMS Toolbar")

4. Select **New Query** from the SSMS toolbar again.

   ![The New Query button is highlighted in the SSMS toolbar.](media/ssms-new-query.png "SSMS Toolbar")

5. Next, copy and paste the SQL script below into the new query window. This script enables Service broker on the `WideWorldImporters` database.

   ```sql
   USE [WideWorldImporters];
   GO

   -- Grant the sqlmiuser ALTER database permissions
   GRANT ALTER ON DATABASE:: WideWorldImporters TO sqlmiuser;
   GO

   -- Enable Service Broker
   ALTER DATABASE WideWorldImporters
   SET ENABLE_BROKER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE;
   GO
   ```

6. To run the script, select **Execute** from the SSMS toolbar.

   ![The Execute button is highlighted in the SSMS toolbar.](media/ssms-execute.png "SSMS Toolbar")

You should follow all steps provided _before_ performing the Hands-on lab.
